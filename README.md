npm install
```

### Running the App

- To start the project run the following command in your terminal

```
expo start
```

#### Running the App on Your Mobile Device

After using the "expo start" command to run the app, you can use 'e' to send yourself an email with a link to the app. This can then be opened in your mobile device to run the app through your mobile device's Expo app. Alternatively, you can use your mobile device to scan the provided QR code displayed in the command line interface.

#### Running the App with Emulator/Simulator

With the command line interface open after using the 'expo start' command, press 'a' to run the app with an Android emulator, or press 'i' to run the app with iOS simulator. Make sure the emulator/simulator is already open. I found that the Android emulator, albeit being a very useful software, drains too much of my computer's resources.
